# Go Static

Promoting the benefits of Static Site Generators and removing the FUD around them


## Story

### What is static?

Static means generating content once (or rather on every change), rather than every time the content is requested.


### What are the benefits of going static?

#### Faster

The speed and efficiency at scale can be at times 8 times faster and therefore 8 times cheaper.
Nothing loads in a browser faster than a plain html file.

You need less server hardware and electricity, so it's a __cheaper__ and __green__ option to a traditional PHP architecture.
