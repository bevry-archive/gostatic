# Go Static

Promoting the benefits of Static Site Generators and removing the FUD around them


## Story

### What is static?

Static means generating content once (or rather on every change), rather than every time the content is requested.


### What are the benefits of going static?

- Fast
- Secure
- Often file based (not all the time however)
- Often abstract friendly (not all the time however)


### How is static implemented?

- Caching on Dynamic Sites
- Static Site Generators
- Hybrid Static Site Generators


### What implementations already exist?

Listing of all of static site generators, and static extensions for dynamic sites.

Currently alphabetically sorted, but will move to a listing that is sorted by their live github stars once we get a website up.
