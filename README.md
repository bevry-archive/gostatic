# Go Static

Promoting the benefits of Static Site Generators and removing the FUD around them


## Story

### What is static?

Static means generating content once (or rather on every change), rather than every time the content is requested.


### What are the benefits of going static?

- Faster
- Securer
- Often file based (not all the time however)
  - no database to maintain
  - edit sourcefiles with servertools (grep etc)
- Often abstract friendly (not all the time however)


### How is static implemented?

- Caching on Dynamic Sites
- Static Site Generators
- Hybrid Static Site Generators

### Features

Features you expect from common Content-Management-Systems

- Clean URLs and Permalinks 
- HTML-metatags
- RSS are availible as extra view 
- third party widgets like maps

#### Missing

- comments, but can be substituted with JavaScript (e.g. disqus.com)
- search function, but can be substituted external search engines  
- widgets like current comments, tweets, quotes of the day. Theses features can be added with asynchronus JavaScript
- categories or tags
- webbased content editing
- editorial workflow
